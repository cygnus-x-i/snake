The buggiest game of snake you've ever played

not much else to say.

i did make the snake invulnerable to killing itself because I got annoyed, then forgot how to change it back.
the game also just crashes itself instead of closing properly.  It's not a bug, it's a feature.

Couldn't be bothered to fix it.
